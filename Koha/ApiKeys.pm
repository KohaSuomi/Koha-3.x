Granting an ApiKey should be easy. This creates a new ApiKey for the given Borrower,
or sets the owner of an existing key.
$PARAM1 HASHRef of params, {
            borrower => MANDATORY, a Koha::Borrower or something castable to one.
            apiKey   => OPTIONAL, an existing Koha::ApiKEy to give to somebody else.
                                not sure why anybody would want to do that, but
                                provided as a convenience for testing.
