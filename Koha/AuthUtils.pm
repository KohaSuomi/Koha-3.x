=head1 NAME

Koha::AuthUtils - utility routines for authentication

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Koha::AuthUtils qw/hash_password/;
    my $hash = hash_password($password);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides utility functions related to managing
user passwords.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 hash_password

    my $hash = Koha::AuthUtils::hash_password($password, $settings);

=cut

# Using Bcrypt method for hashing. This can be changed to something else in future, if needed.
sub hash_password {
    my $password = shift;

    # Generate a salt if one is not passed
    my $settings = shift;
    unless( defined $settings ){ # if there are no settings, we need to create a salt and append settings
    # Set the cost to 8 and append a NULL
        $settings = '$2a$08$'.en_base64(generate_salt('weak', 16));
    }
    # Encrypt it
    return bcrypt($password, $settings);
}

=head2 generate_salt

    my $salt = Koha::Auth::generate_salt($strength, $length);

=over

=item strength

For general password salting a C<$strength> of C<weak> is recommend,
For generating a server-salt a C<$strength> of C<strong> is recommended

'strong' uses /dev/random which may block until sufficient entropy is acheived.
'weak' uses /dev/urandom and is non-blocking.

=item length

C<$length> is a positive integer which specifies the desired length of the returned string
