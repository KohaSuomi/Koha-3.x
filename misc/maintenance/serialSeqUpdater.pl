This script updates the koha.serial.pattern_[xyz] -columns by splitting the
koha.serial.serialseq-column using a regexp.
This is used to maintain tricky patterns and fix possible error caused by the Serials module.

This script has the following parameters :
    -h --help         This help.

    -v --verbose      Integer 1, prints warnings.
                              2, prints everything that happens.

    -s --splitter     Regexp This regexp is used to separate the patterns from the serialseq.
                             Is used with the Perl's split()-command.

Examples:

perl serialSeqUpdater.pl --verbose 2 -s ':'

ENDUSAGE

if ($help) {
    print $usage;
    exit;
}
unless ($regexp) {
    print $usage."\n";
    print "You must define a --splitter!\n";
    exit 1;
}
