Enhancements in 3.16.3
======================

Circulation
----------
    11703   Convert checkouts table to Ajax datatable. This means
            that when bringing up the patron details page or the
            checkout page, the patron's lists of current loans and
            holds are fetched separately, reducing the delay for
            displaying the page if the patron has a large number
            of transactions.

======================


Circulation
----------
