Sets the C4::Context->userenv with nice default values, like:
 -Being in 'CPL'

@PARAM1 Koha::Borrower, this object must be persisted to DB beforehand, sets the userenv for this borrower
        or BorrowerFactory-params, which create a new borrower and set the userenv for it.
@RETURNS Koha::Borrower, the userenv borrower if it was created
