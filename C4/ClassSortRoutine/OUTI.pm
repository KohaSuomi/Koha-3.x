=head1 NAME 

C4::ClassSortRoutine::OUTI - OUTI call number sorting key routine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use C4::ClassSortRoutine;

my $cn_sort = GetClassSortKey('OUTI', $cn_class, $cn_item);

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 get_class_sort_key

  my $cn_sort = C4::ClassSortRoutine::OUTI::OUTI($cn_class, $cn_item);

Generates sorting key using the following rules:

* Concatenates class and item part skipping the location part (since doesn't make any sense in OUTI).
* Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
