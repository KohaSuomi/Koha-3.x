    <h4>A short introduction to batch overlaying</h4>
    <span>
        <p>This tools helps you to overlay large amounts of items quickly with the fully catalogued counterpart.</p>
        <p>Simply read barcodes into the large white text area on the left. The barcode can be anything in the item you are holding,
            but it must be present in the MARC-record. Each row represents a separate overlaying action so separate barcodes with new lines.
            Actually this should happen automatically when you read a barcode.</p>
        <p>Click "Overlay us!" to start the overlaying process.</p>
        <p>A report is generated and possible errors are shown on the top of the page. You can click the report titles to open and close
            the verbose MARCXML difference display. On the right side of the report title you can find a difference-score. The bigger the number,
            the larger the difference between the old bibliographic record and the new merged record. This is a good indication of how much
            the record changed during merging. You can also directly open a MARC-editing view by clicking the report title biblionumbers.</p>
        <b>A permission "tools => stage_marc_import" is needed to use this tool.</b>
    </span>

    <h4>Typical error scenarios</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The record you are looking for doesn't exist in the Koha database (or you get too many results), try using a different query
            and test the results using basic keyword searching.</li>
        <li>You have found the record from your Koha database, but not from the external repository. Try an alternate way of accessing the
            repository (eg. z39.50 search) and searching with title + author.</li>
        <li>The standard identifier (EAN,ISBN,ISSN,...) is not correct. This is hard to fix, as the issue can be in our Koha database
            our in the external repository. Verify the standard identifier in our catalogue or try finding the record using title/author search.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h4>How this all actually works?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Each line in the text box represents a basic keyword query, it is actually equivalent to searching straight from the search toolbar.
            The point of these searches is to find the correct bibliographic records from the Koha database for automatic overlaying.</li>
        <li>These searches should return only one result per row (query). From this result the cataloguing source(external repository)
            is decided based on the value in the field 003. Also the overlaying matcher and the possible component part matcher are decided
            based on preconfigured BatchOverlayRules.</li>
        <li>Then a search is performed on the external repository. Query is performed usually (in this order) EAN, ISBN or ISSN until a
            matching MARC record is found. If no record is found (or too many are found), then the cataloguer needs to take action to find
            the proper cataloguing resource.</li>
        <li>The parent record overlaying is based on the preselected Matcher, which defines the (sub)fields to preserve from the old record.
            The Matcher can be easily configured from <a href="/cgi-bin/koha/admin/matching-rules.pl" target="_blank">here</a> if you have
            proper permissions.</li>
        <li>After the parent record is overlayed, a new search for component parts begins. We search for records containing the same field 003
            as the parent and which have the parents field 001 as their subfield 77Xw value, from the parent's external repository. These are
            confirmed component parts and are selected for importing.</li>
        <li>Another Matcher, component part Matcher makes sure that the selected component part records don't already exists in the database
            and thus are not imported twice (which could make a real mess).</li>
        <li>Finally a report is generated about the actions taken and for easy verification of correctness.</li>
    </ol>
