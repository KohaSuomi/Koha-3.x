<h1>Record detail</h1>

<p>In Koha the bibliographic record contains the main information related to the material. This includes things like the title, author, ISBN, etc. This information is stored in Koha in Marc (different flavors of Marc are supported in Koha). Once this information is saved, items or holdings can be attached.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Cataloging in the <a href="http://manual.koha-community.org/[% helpVersion %]/en/cataloging.html#catbibs">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>

<h4>Cataloguing record "push"-feature</h4>
<p>
    If system preference "RemoteAPIs" is configured, all configured remote APIs that this Koha can interact with are shown under
    the "Save"-toolbar link's dropdown menu under "Push to remote".
</p>
<p>
    When the "push"-link is clicked, the currently opened bibliographic record is sent to the chosen remote API. If the operation
    is successful, a radial menu is shown listing all possible operations the remote API allows. If not, a myriad of errors can be
    shown in an alert-dialog.
    <ul>
        <li>You must be logged in to the current Koha instance and to the remote API to authenticate the cross-Koha record transfer.</li>
        <li>You must have the "editcatalogue"->"add_catalogue" -permission in the remote API or a respective permission the API requires.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
