minifySwagger.pl

Reads the swagger.json -file and all referenced JSON-Schema -files and merges
them into one merged and minified version. This minified swagger-file is
intended to be shared to our API consumers.

By default you must run this script from the same directory as the 'swagger.json'
and the minified specification is written to 'swagger.min.json'.
This is a convenience to make the minification process as easy as possible.

!DO NOT! set the executable flag on, or this can be ran from the internetz.

  -h --help             This happy helpful help!

  -v --verbose          0, default, no output.
                        1, turn on internal Swagger debugging flags
                        2, more verbose Swagger2 debugging

  -s --source           Which Swagger2-specification file to minify?
                        Defaults to "swagger.json"

  -d --destination      Where to write the minified Swagger2-spec?
                        Defaults to "swagger.min.json"

EXAMPLES:

    perl minifySwagger.pl -v 1 -s api/v1/swagger/swagger.json -d swag.json
    cd api/v1/swagger && perl minifySwagger.pl
